<h1>Habit Logger Project</h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Simple project made to track habits in an sqlite database via a C# console application</p>
<h3>Assigned requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is an application where you’ll register one habit.</li>
  <li>This habit can't be tracked by time (ex. hours of sleep), only by quantity (ex. number of water glasses a day)</li>
  <li>The application should store and retrieve data from a real database</li>
  <li>When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database, if one isn’t present.</li>
  <li>It should also create a table in the database, where the habit will be logged.</li>
  <li>The app should show the user a menu of options.</li>
  <li>The users should be able to insert, delete, update and view their logged habit.</li>
  <li>You should handle all possible errors so that the application never crashes.</li>
  <li>The application should only be terminated when the user inserts 0.</li>
  <li>You can only interact with the database using raw SQL. You can’t use mappers such as Entity Framework.</li>
  <li>Your project needs to contain a Read Me file where you'll explain how your app works.</li>
</ul>
